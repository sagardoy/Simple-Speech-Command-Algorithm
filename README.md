# Simple-Speech-Command-Algorithm
The purpose of this project was to build an algorithm that can understand a small library of 10 simple commands while being able to ignore, or distinguish from, unknown commands. I submitted this work for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree in June 2018.
